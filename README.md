## Game Overview

Block Tower is a fun and addictive game where players aim to stack blocks as high as they can without toppling the tower. The game features simple gameplay where players click or tap to drop each block onto the tower. The tower's stability is affected by the positioning and alignment of the blocks, adding a physics simulation aspect to the game. Players are challenged to stack blocks vertically and create the tallest tower possible. The game keeps track of the player's score, and if the tower becomes too unstable and collapses, the game ends. It's a test of precision, timing, and strategic thinking.
